1. Download the source code from https://github.com/leeneil/peaknet , i.e.

```
git clone https://github.com/leeneil/peaknet.git
```

2. To get the complete dataset, go to https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sl0hfOCm_pWJa_gN9XzqtU9Ow_UrPtaQ . Unfortunately this is a Stanford only link. Download any/all of the files there, put them under data/ under the peaknet/ and untar if it is compressed, i.e.

```
cd peaknet/data
tar zxvf FILENAME
```
